# being used as a dependency elsewhere in the tree to get access to net_errors.h. This is wrong -
# targets shouldn't declare a dependency on an executable just to get access to their header files.
# The right fix is to define an API target with the errors, preferably in a fidl file, and have
# other targets depend on that so the name of the executable target can be a detail internal to the
# package target.
